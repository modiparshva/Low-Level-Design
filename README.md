# 🏗️ Low Level Design (LLD) Repository

Welcome to my **Low Level Design (LLD)** learning journey! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of concepts, patterns, and problem-solving strategies in **system design** at the code/architecture level.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

As I explore and learn LLD, I’ll be committing well-structured notes, diagrams, and implementations on:

- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
- 🎯 **SOLID Principles**
- 🏷️ **Design Patterns** (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)
- 📦 **Scalable Class Design**
- 🧩 **System Modeling**
- 🛠️ **LLD of Real-World Applications** (like BookMyShow, Splitwise, etc.)
- 🔁 **Interview Case Studies**
- 📄 UML Diagrams and Class Diagrams

## 🧠 Why Low Level Design?

> "Good design is as little design as possible." – Dieter Rams

Understanding **LLD** bridges the gap between **high-level architecture** and **actual code**. It's the secret sauce behind clean codebases and robust systems. 🧪

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo will be updated regularly as I progress through various topics. Stay tuned! 🔄
